TagBudget is a simple budget tracking web application that uses tweet style updates from user to specify money transactions
over one or multiple user accounts. In the near future TagBudget will be able to report common currency-to-currency transactions over 
time periods to the user aswell as creating user data predicitions for near future periods.

of the application, all this under very terrible ui that really leaves alot of shame to the current project ui designer.

## V0.2 
TagBudget V0.2 show a whole new api showing the full applications functionality under json data communications,
with the help of an JS framework for the graph and data modeling.
